        <h2>Why Do People Own Aggressive Dogs?</h2>
        <p>
            Aggressive dogs are often owned for specific purposes, such as protection, guarding property, or as status symbols. Some breeds are naturally more assertive and territorial, making them ideal for roles in security or law enforcement. Additionally, some owners may be drawn to the perceived strength and loyalty of these breeds, believing they can provide a sense of safety. However, owning an aggressive dog requires responsible training, socialization, and a deep understanding of the breed's needs to ensure they are well-behaved and safe around others.

        <h2>Common Aggressive Breeds</h2>
        <p>
            While aggression is often a result of poor training or mistreatment, certain breeds are more prone to aggressive tendencies due to their instincts and history. Here are some breeds often labeled as aggressive:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pit Bull Terrier:</strong> Known for their strength and loyalty, but often misunderstood due to their history in dogfighting.</li>
            <li><strong>Rottweiler:</strong> A powerful and protective breed that requires experienced handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Doberman Pinscher:</strong> Intelligent and loyal, but can be territorial if not properly trained.</li>
            <li><strong>German Shepherd:</strong> Often used in police and military roles due to their intelligence and protective nature.</li>
        </ul>
